INSTALLATION

- make sure you have some version of python installed
  (check with 'which python')
- place a copy of mgit in the source folder of your Mathematica (R) git
  working copy
- cd into the project directory
- run ./install-mgit.sh

DESCRIPTION

After the installation of mgit all commits executed via the command line will
trigger a 'git pre-commit hook' that rewrites all modified or created
Mathematica (R) notebook files, such that they are in a kind of normal form.

For these files the line-based style of git is functional, and merge-conflicts
will arise when different changes within one formula (Cell) are conflicting.

Merge conflicts that are arising due to different changes within the same cell
can be easily solved using a provided merge-tool (name: mgit).

USAGE

1. notebook normalization
-------------------------

this is done automatically once mgit is installed

2. git merge conflict resolution
--------------------------------

- cd in the root folder of the project-directory
- check whether the merge conflict is resolvable using classical merge tools
  (i.e. the conflict arose due to notebook-properties and not changes inside
  a Cell)
- if this is not the case, run the command
  mgit/mgit path/to/conflict/file.nb
- choose the branch of your choice (by push of a button) for each conflict
  that appears in the notebook file.
